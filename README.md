### Hi there 👋

<!--
**SHI200005/SHI200005** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on nothing but to survive (能活着就不错了)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning several languages, such as Italian and German
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with everything about coding
- 💬 Ask me about nothing
- 📫 How to reach me: slnsinlangmc@sina.com
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them (Actually I use 'she/her' in real life, but I prefer 'they/them' on the Internet. I even prefer 'the author' more.)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a robot.
- 我是一条快乐的物理狗，不会写代码，上 GitHub 纯属瞎玩。还请各位大佬带带我，谢谢！
- I am a happy physics dog (I am a physics student, knowing nothing about computer science or software engineering). I don't know how to code. I sign in my GitHub account for fun. I will appreciate it if anyone of you, Big Laos (sophisticated programmers), give me a helping hand! Thank you very much!
